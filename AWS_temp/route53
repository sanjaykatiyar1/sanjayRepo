Health Checking

Amazon Route 53 health checks monitor the health of your resources such as web servers and email servers. You can configure CloudWatch alarms for your health checks, so that you receive notification when a resource becomes unavailable. You can also configure Amazon Route 53 to route Internet traffic away from resources that are unavailable. For more information about using Amazon Route 53 to monitor the health of your resources, see Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover.
